<p>The Yash starrer KGF, which hit the silver screens on December 21, has turned out to be a big hit. The film was released in five languages â€“ Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Hindi. The Kannada version is doing well at theatres and is expected to break box office records. The Telugu version has also found good patronage, with KGF doing well in both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Reports indicate that the Tamil version of KGF faced stiff competition from Tamil movies such as Maari 2 and Seethakaathi that also released the same week. In Malayalam, the good word of mouth could help in increasing the number of screens, say sources. The Hindi version has also recorded good collections at the box office. The exact figures for this magnum opus should be out soon.</p>

	<p>
According to reports, the movie has made almost Rs 60 crores in three days. And the good news is that box office collections have steadily increased over the days. While the movie raked in Rs 18.1 crore on the first day, it increased its collection to Rs 19.2 crore on the second day. IE reported that on the third day, the movie made Rs 22.4 crore at the Indian box office. According to entertainment industry trackers, the movie is doing well abroad too.</p>
